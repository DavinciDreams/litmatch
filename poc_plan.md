# PoC Plan: Computer Vision Anomaly Detection in Error Logs

## Scope
This proof-of-concept (PoC) focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to detect anomalies within error log files. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of visual-based anomaly detection compared to traditional text-based approaches.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate the application of computer vision for log anomaly detection.
- Compare detection accuracy and performance against baseline methods.
- Identify strengths, limitations, and potential use cases for visual anomaly detection in log analysis.

## Technical Approach
- **Data Preparation:** Convert error log files into visual representations (e.g., images, heatmaps).
- **Model Selection:** Utilize pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or custom architectures for anomaly detection.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Train models on labeled log images, validate using a holdout set, and analyze detection results.
- **Integration:** Develop scripts to automate log-to-image conversion and model inference.

## Benchmarks
- **Detection Accuracy:** Precision, recall, and F1-score compared to text-based methods.
- **Performance:** Inference speed and resource utilization.
- **Robustness:** Ability to generalize across different log formats and error types.

## Extensibility Suggestions
- Expand to multi-modal analysis combining text and image features.
- Integrate with real-time log monitoring systems.
- Support additional log formats and anomaly types.
- Explore unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches for broader applicability.
